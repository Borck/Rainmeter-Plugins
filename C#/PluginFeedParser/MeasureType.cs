// Overview: This example demonstrates a basic implementation of a parent/child
// measure structure. In this particular example, we have a "parent" measure
// which contains the values for the options "ValueA", "ValueB", and "ValueC".
// The child measures are used to return a specific value from the parent.

// Use case: You could, for example, have a "main" parent measure that queries
// information some data set. The child measures can then be used to return
// specific information from the data queried by the parent measure.

// Sample skin:
